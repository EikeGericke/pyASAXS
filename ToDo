pyASAXS
A Python project for the absolute normalization of ASAXS data.

Mile stones: 
1	2D scattering image to 1D scattering curve batch integrator
2	Generate Pandas data base from ASCII dumps of HDF files, assign empty, backgr., and refference by hand
3	Grap 1D curves and normalize and save
4	assign empty, backgr., and refference automatically
5	Read HDF instead of ASCII
6	handle 2D images
